# How-to-use-github
Just a basic tutorial to myself of using github and git
1. Setting up Github after registring on github.
2. Download and install Git and register your username and email on Git Bash
3. Now we can use git commands on Vscode editor
   
   **Add Repositories from Github**
   
1. To clone directories from Github use : **git clone <link-of-repo>**
2. Use cd command to change repos(ls to list all github repo items)
3. Get repo status using **git status** command

   **Add new files to github and append it into online repo**

1. Use command Git **git add <file-name>**

  **To modify changes in a file**
  
1. First we have to make the file **staged** means ready to modify for that we have to first use **git add** to make it staged.
2. To add every new file and make it staged use **git add .**

   **Now we commit our project or repo**

To commit on git use **git commit -m "some message"**

   **After modifying everything we push our new work on github**
For that we use **git push origin main** command

<b>This command is saved from vscode to github using add, commit and  git push origin main</b>
